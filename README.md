# Supply Chain Analytics in Power BI

## Overview
This project involves a **Make vs Buy Analysis Tool** developed in Power BI to help Tanate Industries (a fictitious company selling replacement parts for industrial pizza ovens) determine whether to manufacture parts in-house or purchase them from external suppliers. The tool calculates and compares the full costs of both options, enabling data-driven decision-making.

## Key Concepts
### What is Supply Chain?
A **supply chain** is the network of individuals and companies involved in creating a product and delivering it to the consumer. It encompasses everything from raw materials to production, logistics, and distribution.

### What is Make vs Buy?
The **Make vs Buy decision** is a strategic choice between:
- **Make**: Producing a product or component in-house.
- **Buy**: Purchasing the product or component from an external supplier.

This analysis considers costs, capacity, and other factors to determine the most economical option.

## Problem Statement
Tanate Industries needed a tool to:
1. Compare the **full cost** of manufacturing parts internally (Make) versus purchasing them from suppliers (Buy).
2. Analyze production volumes and associated expenses.
3. Make informed decisions to optimize costs and resource allocation.

## Power BI Implementation
### Features
- **Cost Breakdown**: Visualizes the sum of extended costs and non-recurring expenses for suppliers.
- **Scenario Planner**: Compares "Buy Scenario Full Cost" across different volumes and suppliers.
- **Make vs Buy Analysis**: Calculates cost avoidance and recommends the optimal decision (Make or Buy) for each part.
- **Interactive Filters**: Allows users to explore data by part number, supplier, and volume.

### Key Visuals
1. **Cost Comparison by Supplier**:
   - Bar charts comparing total costs (e.g., Widgetmakers, Inc. vs Ringo Nova).
2. **Make vs Buy Decision Matrix**:
   - Table showing cost avoidance and recommended decisions.
3. **Volume Analysis**:
   - Graphs displaying costs across different production volumes.

## Results
The tool revealed significant cost savings for Tanate Industries, such as:
- **Make Decision**: Parts like `P0914` (Chattlecrat) were cheaper to produce in-house, saving `$820,435.07`.
- **Buy Decision**: Parts like `P1010` (Bewpittros) were more economical to purchase, avoiding costs of `$4,646,958.98`.
